# Visualizing Los Angeles Hospitals, and Simulating COVID-19 on an Unprotected UCLA

## Case and Hospital Map

- **Authors**: Laurel Woods, Sydney Kovach, and Radhika Ahuja

## Hypothetical Resources Line Chart

- **Authors**: Andrew Kan and Radhika Ahuja

- **Libraries**: [chart.js line chart](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html)

- **Inspiration**: [this piece](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/covid-hospitals) but localize it to UCLA

- **Main Hurdles**:

  - making the chart responsive (make_responsive function)

  - updating the chart with the slider and switch, which was done using the update_line_chart function
