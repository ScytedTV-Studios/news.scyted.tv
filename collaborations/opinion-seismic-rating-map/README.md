Article: [https://dailybruin.com/2021/09/22/editorial-ucla-must-strengthen-building-protocols-prepare-for-earthquake-possibility](https://dailybruin.com/2021/09/22/editorial-ucla-must-strengthen-building-protocols-prepare-for-earthquake-possibility)

Leaflet map with markers that display each researched building and a pop up with their name, address, retrofit year (if applicable), and date of construction. Buildings are organized by seismic ratings.

## Notes

For uploading to the server, the width and height of the map MUST be set to 100vw and 100vh respectively. The actual size on mainsite will be ~700px wide by ~500px tall. Make sure the map looks okay at this size while developing.

For copy edits, include a byline below the map but REMOVE it before uploading to the server. Format: "Graphic reporting by < whoever gathered data >, title. Interactive by < you! >, title.

## JavaScript libraries

* leaflet

  * used an overlapping marker spidifier plugin to space out markers

NOTE: had issues using leaflet version 1.7.1, it was causing bugs on mobile where 2 click events fired so popups would close immediately. solved by using version 1.6.0
